chdir to an example

$ cd some_example

look out for .gc files (read them), then run

some_example$ gnucap some_file.gc

NOTE

in order for this to work, you need to copy in (or symlink) the component
libraries as included by the .gc file. (that might be better in future
versions.)

some_example$ cp $(pkgincludedir)/somefile.v .

pkgincludedir defaults to /usr/local/include/gnucap-geda
