This  branch 'lang_gschem' is off the 2009.12.07 dev snapshot.
Aims to add the functionality of parsing a schematic into a verilog netlist and building a schematic given a (augmented)netlist in verilog.

In order to load lang_geda as a plugin, compile as follows:
    g++ -DHAVE_GEDA -shared -fPIC -o lang_geda.so lang_geda.cc d_net.cc d_place.cc  $(pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0 --libs libgeda)

load as follows
-------------
gnucap>load ./lang_geda.so
-------------

Additional Package Information (by Felix Salfelder):

this gnucap-module package depends on yet unreleased upstream changes
- lang_verilog.cc patch
- d_coment.cc patch
- gnucap development helpers
these are included in the 'dev' branch on tool/git/gnucap

if you do not insist on doing everything manually, you may just
-1) wait for gnucap+dev release
0) run ./autogen.sh (not necessary when using release tarball)
1) optional: ./configure --prefix=/your/favourite/prefix
2) make install

then loading works independently of cwd:
gnucap>load lang_geda.so
