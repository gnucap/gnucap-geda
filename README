lang_geda aims to add the functionality of parsing, writing and simulating geda
schematics.

In order to load lang_geda as a plugin, compile as follows:
g++ -DHAVE_GEDA -shared -fPIC -o lang_geda.so lang_geda.cc \
   d_net.cc d_place.cc  $(pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0 --libs libgeda)

load as follows
-------------
gnucap>load ./lang_geda.so
-------------

this gnucap-module package depends on yet unreleased upstream changes some are
included in the 'dev' branch on tool/git/gnucap. all are included in the "geda"
branch. see TODO.

if you do not insist on doing everything manually, see INSTALL
after installation loading works independently of cwd:
gnucap>load lang_geda.so
