lang_geda aims to add the functionality of parsing, writing and simulating geda
schematics.

lang_geda.cc implements two commands
- gschem
  equivalent to options lang=gschem. changes the interpreted language to gschem
- geda <args>
  miscellaneous commands related to geda modules and schematics. for example
  "geda file.sch module" loads an instanciable (module/subcircuit) from a gschem
  schematic file. this is under construction, please refer to the tests
  subdirectory for examples.

d_{net,port,rail,place,gedasckt}.cc implement various geda related devices.
these express extra semantics of instances found in geda schematics.

------------
In order to load lang_geda as a plugin, compile as follows:
g++ -DHAVE_GEDA -shared -fPIC -o lang_geda.so lang_geda.cc \
   d_net.cc d_place.cc  $(pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0 --libs libgeda)

load as follows
-------------
gnucap>load ./lang_geda.so
-------------

this package now provides (some) component implementations for (some) geda symbols.
e.g. if you use "analog" symbols from geda, use "`gedalib analog.v" to load the
implementations. (this is slightly in flux/under construction).

this gnucap-module package works best with unstable gnucap (or gnucap-uf).
