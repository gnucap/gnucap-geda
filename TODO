For lang_geda (gEDA plugin)

**TODO (In the order of preference)
- handle unconnected ports (currently: open)
- default port values (how?)
- global nets (via default values?)
- rearrange !_-prefixed declarations
- gEDA style commands
- Create augmented verilog netlist from a verilog netlist
- replace extranet by multiport net (needed?)

**don't know how
- print hierarchical schematic in a useful way

**gnucap issues (0.36), (*)=fixed/hacked/worked\ around for gnucap-uf
- precalc_first is 'printing parameter <basename> has no value' (*)

**optional/later/unimportant
- supplement more gEDA symbols (include/*.va)
- more nets/ports (node numbering && behaviour)
- Hack a button/option into gschem to get a netlist in verilog from gnucap
