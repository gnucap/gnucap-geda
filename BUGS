- geda deprecation warnings...
- lots of "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value" in libguile
- cannot access things with labels containing uppercases from insensitive spice
- equal pinlabels not handled
- bad connection error handling/reporting
- need to ask geda where the schematics are (like symbols)
